Tic-Tac-Toe Minimax Algorithm
================================================================================
Overview
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### [Project Demo][Demo]

**Date created:** Summer 2015/16.

### Project description:

This is a Minimax algorithm implementation built on top of a Tic-Tac-Toe game I made in my free time.


### Where can I learn more about the minimax algorithm?

Now that I am CS student with more knowledge and experience, I really don't recommend how I learned to write this algorithm. (brute-forcing missing knowledge where needed)

Instead, I would recommend going through an Algorithms and Data structure book for starters like [Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne][Algorithms_4th]. Then watch some supplementary material:

- [Minimax algorithm - A brief description ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ELUvkSkCts)
- [A simple animation of the Minimax algorithm ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDskcx8FStA)

Then read: (I recommend Java or C++ guides)

- [Tic-Tac-Toe: Understanding the Minimax Algorithm ](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax)

And that should be good enough for a start.
